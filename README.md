# GEDI - A cashboard transaction tracker
A simple transaction track web app with a Galactic Empire Star Wars theme. Made using Ruby, SQL, Sinatra, HTML & CSS.

## About
This was the first project done at CodeClan, after 4 weeks of learning to code. I was given the task of designing a "money dashboard" style web app. I used a Star Wars theme, calling the app GEDI - Galactic Empire Disbursement Investor (yes, that is intended to be clever word-play). The user can add transactions, which displays the date added, merchant, category and total spent. The minimum viable product spec was as shown: 

### MVP 
* Create new transactions
* Display a list of all transactions
* Display total amount spent
* Display total amount spent by tag
