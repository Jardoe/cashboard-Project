# GEDI - A cashboard transaction tracker
A simple transaction track web app with a Galactic Empire Star Wars theme. Made using Ruby, SQL, Sinatra, HTML & CSS.

## About
This was the first project done at CodeClan, after 4 weeks of learning to code. I was given the task of designing a "money dashboard" style web app. I used a Star Wars theme, calling the app GEDI (Galactic Empire Disbursement Investor (yes, that is intended to be clever word-play)). The user can add transactions, which displays the date added, merchant and category the purchase was in.
