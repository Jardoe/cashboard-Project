# GEDI - A cashboard transaction tracker
A simple transaction track web app with a Galactic Empire Star Wars theme. Made using Ruby, SQL, Sinatra, HTML & CSS.

## About
This was the first project done at CodeClan, after 4 weeks of learning to code. I was given the task of designing a "money dashboard" style web app. I used a Star Wars theme, calling the app GEDI - Galactic Empire Disbursement Investor (yes, that is intended to be clever word-play). The user can add transactions, which displays the date added, merchant, category and total spent. The minimum viable product spec was as shown: 

### MVP 
* Create new transactions
* Display a list of all transactions
* Display total amount spent
* Display total amount spent by category

### Extensions I added
* CRUD functionality of merchants and categories
* User can input dates for each transaction
* Monthly budgets (though this wasn't fully implemented)
* A link to hyperspace, just in case the user needs to escape from the pesky rebels.

## Reflection
I really enjoyed creating my first project, and definitely learned a lot. I completed the MVP without any real issues. Once I started the extensions, however, due to not having a fleshed out plan, I struggled giving myself a proper sense of direction. This led to not fully implementing the extensions that I wanted to do.  Overall, this was an interesting first project, and I learned a lot.  

To note, only a week was spent on this project. I have not edited it since.
